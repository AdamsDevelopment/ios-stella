======

Stella contains a set of utilities that can be used during iOS development in Swift.

## Installation

Stella is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install it, simply add the following line to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'Stella', '~> 0.1'
```

## Utilities

### Localization

Localize a key in no time with this handy localization function.

```swift
let key = "this_is_your_localization_key"
print(key.localizedString)
// The debug console will print the localized
// string found in your .strings file.
```

### Printing

Add something extra to your debug output. There are *three* extra functions available for you to use.

```swift
printAction("This is a user action.")
// The debug console will print `üéØ This is a user action.`

printBreadcrumb("This is your breadcrumb.")
// The debug console will print `üçû This is your breadcrumb.`

printError("This is an error.")
// The debug console will print `üî• This is an error.`
```

### Threading

Perform block on the main or on the background queue more easily.

```swift
dispatch_on_main {
  // Perform this code on the main thread.
}

dispatch_on_main(after: 2) {
  // Perform this code on the main thread after 2 seconds.
}

dispatch_in_background {
  // Perform this code on a background thread.
}

dispatch_wait { completion in
  // Perform an asynchronous call to a web service for example.
  performCall {
    // Notify the `dispatch_wait` that the asynchronous call finished it's execution.
    completion()
  }
}
```
